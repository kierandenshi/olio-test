# README

This is a Ruby on Rails application produced as a possible solution to the coding task described [here]('https://tech.olioex.com/rails-coding-task.html')

To get this app running locally, please ensure your system has the proper prerequisites installed. These are:

- Ruby version 3.1.2
- SQLite3







## Improvements

- Extract "like" functions into own Model with polymorphic associations so the function can be shared across concerns. Tidier routing for the "likes" resources.
- More controller tests
- Automated browser tests
